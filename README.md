MERN SOCIAL MEDIA APP

"Crew Social Media" is a Full Stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) Application that serves as a simple social media platform. The application enables users to share and post interesting events or memories from their lives. By using the combination of React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, I have created a powerful and efficient solution. Users can like posts, add and remove friends, view profiles, register, login, and logout. Additionally, I pay special attention to security, where authentication is implemented to ensure secure access to the application's features. Technologies like JSON Web Tokens (JWT) can be utilized for authentication and authorization purposes.
